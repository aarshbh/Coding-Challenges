   to "10". Log your answer to the console.
   
3. Check once again to see whether a is equal to "10", this time making 
   sure to check against the type as well. Log your answer to the 
    console.
      
4. If x is equal to "5" and y is equal to 6, what would 
    the result of the following be ?
    x !==y ?
